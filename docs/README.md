# Extended Payment Network Documentation

Welcome to the Extended Payment Network documentation. This documentation provides comprehensive information about our scalable, decentralized payment system built on an actor-based architecture.

## What is Extended Payment Network?

The Extended Payment Network is a high-performance payment system that combines:
- Actor-based architecture for scalability
- Off-chain payment channels for efficiency
- Multi-signature capabilities for security
- Hierarchical state management for consistency

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized into three main sections:

### 1. Architecture
Learn about the system's core design, components, and protocols:
- [System Overview](architecture/overview.md)
- [Core Components](architecture/components.md)
- [Network Protocols](architecture/protocols.md)

### 2. Implementation
Understand the implementation details:
- [State Management](implementation/state-management.md)
- [Entity System](implementation/entities.md)
- [Payment Channels](implementation/channels.md)

### 3. Technical Details
Dive deep into technical specifications:
- [Merkle Trees](technical/merkle.md)
- [Consensus Mechanism](technical/consensus.md)
- [Storage System](technical/storage.md)
