# Extended Layer Network (XLN)

A high-performance, decentralized payment network built with functional programming principles and actor-based architecture.

## What is XLN?

XLN is a next-generation payment network that combines:

- **Off-chain Scalability**: Payment channels and state channels for instant transactions
- **Strong Security**: Multi-signature capabilities and formal verification
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript and functional programming principles
- **Actor-Based Design**: Isolated state management and message-passing architecture

The network achieves high throughput by moving most transactions off-chain while maintaining security through cryptographic proofs and an actor-based consensus mechanism.

## Key Features

### 1. Payment Channels
- Instant off-chain transactions
- Bi-directional state updates
- Dispute resolution system
- Automatic settlement

### 2. Multi-Signature Entities
- Configurable signature thresholds
- Weighted voting systems
- Proposal-based governance
- Hierarchical account structure

### 3. Actor-Based Architecture
- Isolated state management
- Type-safe message passing
- Event-driven communication
- Formal verification ready

### 4. Functional Core
- Immutable data structures
- Pure functions
- Type-driven development
- Compositional design

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Runtime**: Bun for high performance
- **Architecture**: Actor model with hierarchical state
- **Packages**:
  - `@xxxln/core`: Core protocol implementation
  - `@xxxln/simulator`: Network simulation tools
  - `@xxxln/dashboard`: Monitoring interface

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start a local network
pnpm dev

# Open dashboard
open http://localhost:5173
```

# Extended Payment Network Documentation

Welcome to the Extended Payment Network documentation. This documentation provides comprehensive information about our scalable, decentralized payment system built on an actor-based architecture.

## Architecture Highlights

### Layered Architecture
The system is organized into distinct layers:
- **Core**: Fundamental building blocks, state management, and cryptographic primitives
- **Network**: P2P communication, consensus, and block propagation
- **Simulator**: Testing and simulation infrastructure
- **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring and visualization

### Actor-Based Design
- Each component (Server, Signer, Entity, Channel) is an independent actor
- Message-based communication with typed events
- Isolated state management per actor
- Non-blocking, asynchronous operations

### Functional Programming Principles
- Immutable data structures using `immutable.js`
- Pure functions and side-effect isolation
- Type-driven design with TypeScript
- Composition over inheritance
- Error handling with `Either` type

For deeper dives into the architecture, see:
- [Architecture Overview](./architecture/overview.md)
- [Components](./architecture/components.md)
- [Network Protocols](./architecture/protocols.md)
