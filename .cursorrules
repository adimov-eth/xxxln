  description: >
    The assistant thinks and codes in a functional style reminiscent
    of Haskell, paying special attention to purity, immutability, 
    composition, and mathematical correctness. The assistant is also 
    knowledgeable in cryptography, blockchain, actor-based 
    architectures, and hierarchical state management.  

environment:
  language: "TypeScript"
  runtime: "Bun"
  packageManager: "pnpm"
  monorepo: true
  notes:
    - "Never directly edit package.json to install dependencies; always use pnpm."
    - "Organize code as a monorepo (e.g., multiple packages within packages/)."
    - "Use fp-ts for functional programming primitives"
    - "Use io-ts for runtime type validation"
    - "Use immutable.js for immutable data structures"

project:
  overview: >
    A scalable, decentralized payment network built on an actor-based 
    architecture with hierarchical state management. The system 
    combines off-chain payment channels with multi-signature 
    capabilities and event-driven communication to enable secure, 
    efficient transactions.

  key-principles:
    - Strict functional style
    - Decentralized architecture
    - Hierarchical state management (in an FP-compatible manner)
    - Composable design with minimal side effects
    - Off-chain payment channels with multi-signature security
    - Immutability and type safety
    - Discriminated unions for type-safe message passing
    - Either-based error handling

codingStyle:
  # --- High-Level Priorities ---
  priorities:
    - Strong functional programming practices
    - Immutability (no in-place mutation)
    - Short, composable, pure functions
    - Strict TypeScript typing (no any, explicit interfaces & types)
    - Readability, mathematical clarity, correctness over brevity
    - Security and cryptographic best practices
    - Type-driven development
    - Algebraic data types (ADTs)

  # --- Functional Practices ---
  functionalGuidelines:
    - **Pure Functions**: Functions must not produce side effects. 
      - If a side effect is unavoidable (e.g., logging, external I/O), isolate it in a dedicated boundary function or module.
      - Use Either<Error, T> for operations that can fail
      - Use Task<T> or Promise<Either<Error, T>> for async operations
    - **Immutability**: Never mutate function inputs; return new objects or copies if transformations are needed.
      - Use immutable.js Map/List for collections
      - Use readonly modifiers for all types
      - Return new instances instead of modifying existing ones
    - **Composition**: Prefer function composition and higher-order utilities.
      - Use pipe() and flow() from fp-ts for function composition
      - Use map, chain, fold for working with Either and Option types
      - Avoid loops in favor of map/reduce/filter
    - **Type Safety**: 
      - Use discriminated unions for sum types
      - Use interfaces/types with readonly for product types
      - Use io-ts for runtime type validation
      - Never use any or unknown without constraints
    - **Error Handling**:
      - Use Either type for error handling
      - Define specific error types with discriminated unions
      - Avoid throwing exceptions
    - **State Management**:
      - Treat state as immutable
      - Use pure functions for state transitions
      - Return new state instead of modifying existing
      - Version state changes for tracking

  # --- General Guidelines (Extended) ---
  generalGuidelines:
    - Use English for all code and documentation.
    - Explicit typing everywhere (function params, return values, variables).
    - No usage of `any` type; create or reuse appropriate interfaces, union types, etc.
    - Use JSDoc for documenting public modules or top-level functions that are part of an API.
    - Avoid blank lines **within** a function body; keep them short and focused.
    - Only one `export` per file to encourage modular design.
    - Use pipe() for complex function compositions
    - Prefer type inference for intermediary values in pipes

  nomenclature:
    - Functions/Methods: `camelCase`, must start with a verb (e.g., `computeSignature`, `verifyChannel`).
    - Constants: `UPPER_CASE` if truly constant across application. 
    - Types & Interfaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserCredentials`, `PaymentChannel`).
    - Files & Directories: `PascalCase`.
    - Booleans: use `isX`, `hasX`, or `canX`.
    - Error types: Must end with 'Error' (e.g., `ValidationError`)
    - Message types: Must be discriminated unions
    - State types: Must be readonly and immutable

  functions:
    - Short single-purpose functions (< 20 instructions).
    - Pure if possible. If side effects are required, isolate them or return a structure indicating the effect.
    - Compose smaller functions rather than nest logic deeply.
    - Use arrow functions for single-expression logic and named functions for more complex operations.
    - Accept/return objects for more complex parameter/return usage (RO-RO approach).
    - Provide defaults for parameters to avoid checking for null/undefined inside.
    - Use Either for error handling
    - Use pipe() for composition
    - Avoid async/await in favor of TaskEither when possible

  data:
    - Represent domain data with sum/product types
    - Use discriminated unions for state machines
    - Use io-ts for runtime type validation
    - Use immutable.js collections
    - Make everything readonly
    - Version all state changes
    - Track causality in state updates

  classes:
    - Avoid classes entirely
    - Use modules of pure functions instead
    - If needed for framework compatibility, use them only as namespaces
    - Never use inheritance
    - Never use this
    - Never mutate state

  exceptions:
    - Never throw exceptions
    - Use Either for error handling
    - Use Option for nullable values
    - Define specific error types
    - Handle all edge cases explicitly

  testing:
    - Property-based testing when possible
    - Pure function testing with explicit inputs/outputs
    - No mocks/stubs - use dependency injection
    - Test error cases explicitly
    - Test state transitions
    - Test message handling
    - Test type validation

additionalGuidelines:
  - Provide complete code examples (no placeholders or `// ...` stubs).
  - If uncertain about something, explicitly state the assumption or data needed (do not guess or invent).
  - Be concise. The code should largely speak for itself.
  - Use fp-ts utilities consistently
  - Handle all error cases explicitly
  - Version all state changes
  - Track message causality

doNot:
  - Directly modify package.json for dependencies; always use pnpm.
  - Use classes or OOP patterns
  - Mutate state
  - Use null/undefined
  - Throw exceptions
  - Use loops
  - Use async/await without Either
  - Use any/unknown
  - Leave error cases unhandled
  - Mix functional and imperative styles
